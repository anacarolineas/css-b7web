                        CTO, and chief designer of SpaceX; early investor,[b] CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.;
                        founder of The Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink; and co-founder and initial co-chairman
                        of OpenAI.
                        A centibillionaire, Musk is one of the richest people in the world.</p>

                    <p>Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa.
                        He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada aged 17 to attend Queen's
                        University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received
                        dual bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend
                        Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding web software
                        company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The start-up was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in
                        1999. Musk co-founded online bank X.com that same year, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to
                        form the company
                        PayPal and was subsequently bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.</p>
                    <p>In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of
                        which he is CEO, CTO, and lead designer. In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla
                        Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect, becoming its CEO in 2008. In
                        2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services company and current Tesla subsidiary.
                        In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that promotes friendly artificial
                        intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing
                        brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company.
                        Musk has also proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system.</p>

                    <p>In the spirit of Steve Jobs and Moneyball, Elon Musk is both an illuminating and authorized look
                        at the extraordinary life of one of Silicon Valley’s most exciting, unpredictable, and ambitious
                        entrepreneurs—a real-life Tony Stark—and a fascinating exploration of the renewal of American
                        invention and its new “makers.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Elon Musk spotlights the technology and vision of Elon Musk, the renowned entrepreneur and
                        innovator behind SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity, who sold one of his Internet companies, PayPal,
                        for $1.5 billion. Ashlee Vance captures the full spectacle and arc of the genius’s life and
                        work, from his tumultuous upbringing in South Africa and flight to the United
                        States to his dramatic technical innovations and entrepreneurial pursuits.</p>
                    <p>Vance uses Musk’s story to explore one of the pressing questions of our age: can the nation of
                        inventors and creators who led the modern world for a century still compete in an age of fierce
                        global competition? He argues that Musk—one of the most unusual and striking figures in American
                        business history—is a contemporary, visionary amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists
                        including Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs. More than any other
                        entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a
                        future that is as rich and far-reaching as the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction
                        fantasy.</p>
